/*
 * Discover pid-provider (function-level) probes by firing them at runtime.
 *
 * Attaches to every entry probe in a process via the pid provider
 * and prints the full probe name on each firing. This traces all
 * function entries, not just USDT static probes. This is a runtime
 * discovery tool — only probes that fire during the window appear.
 *
 * For a static probe listing, use `dtlm probes --pid <pid>`.
 *
 * Usage: dtlm watch usdt-list --param pid=<pid> --duration 1
