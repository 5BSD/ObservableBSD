/*
 * Off-CPU profiler — blocked/waiting stack analysis.
 *
 * Two complementary views:
 * 1. Blocking site frequency: captures the kernel stack at
 *    sched:::off-cpu to show WHERE threads block.
 * 2. Blocked duration: measures elapsed time between off-cpu
 *    and on-cpu, aggregated by process. The on-cpu stack shows
 *    the resume path, not the blocking site (DTrace limitation).
 *
 * For blocking-site + duration correlation, use the frequency
 * view to find hot sites, then examine the duration histogram.
